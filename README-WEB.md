Danger Alerts adds alerts that trigger while your ship is crashing, burning, and all around not having a good time.

It also adds a simple interface that let's you silence, or modify exactly when the alarms go off. Currently, there are two alarms: one for when you're about to crash, and a highly configurable resource alarm for when you're running low on any resource on the vessel. If you have any suggestions, bugs to report, or opinions on your favourite type of potato chip, please post here. I'll reply as soon as I can.
